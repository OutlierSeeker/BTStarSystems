<h1>BATTLETECH Planet Systems README</h1>
<div>
    This utility provides additional options to view and analyze the star systems found in BATTLETECH (2018).
    You can zoom in the map, choose which planets are to be displayed and then save the map to a PNG file. Furthermore,
    you may export some planetary data to a convenient CSV file that you can then import into your favorite spreadsheet program.
</div>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<h3>Folder Selection</h3>
<p>
    When you run <i>BATTLETECH Star Systems</i> for the first time, you will presented with a file selection screen.
    Choose your BATTLETECH <b>main folder </b> (which contains "<i>BattleTech.exe</i>"), e.g. "<i>D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\BATTLETECH</i>"
    like in the following example:<br/>
    <img src="res\readme\fileSelection.png">
</p>
<p>
    <u><i>BATTLETECH Star Systems</i> works with any version of BATTLETECH</u> and reads the star systems' JSON files
    from the data folder.
</p>

<h3>The Main Application</h3>
<img src="res\readme\mainUI.png">

<h3>The Left Panel</h3>
<p>
    In the left panel you can set the attributes of the planets that you want to display. The left radio button column is the default
    setting and means that the attribute may or may not be present on a star system. The middle column means that the
    attribute has to be present while the column means that the attribute may <b>not</b> be present (<i>exclude</i>).
</p>
<p>
    The numbers after each attribute mean how many star systems have this attribute within the current selection. In the
    screenshot above, all attributes are at default and so for this version of BATTLETECH, there are a total of 219 star
    systems.
</p>

<h3>The Star Map</h3>
<p>
    The middle section displays the star map with all systems that fulfill the set attributes. It also has a menu button
    which expands/contracts when clicking on it.

    <ul>
    <li><b>Zooming: </b> The zoom buttons should be self explanatory and are the main reason why I created this program
        (I wanted a nice overview of the <b>whole</b> map instead of only parts of it.
        When zooming out, the systems may overlap, especially when additional information is displayed. </li>
    <li><b>Show Skulls:</b> Displays the skull rating next to each star system.</li>
    <li><b>Show Black Markets:</b> Indicates which system has a black market.</li>
    <li><b>Show Star League:</b> Shows if a planet has a former Star League presence.</li>
    <li><b>Show max. shop items in side panel:</b> Does exactly that.</li>
    <li><b>Show planet description in side panel:</b> I added this just for fun. The description is usually pretty long
        and doesn't add anything useful, but it might still be interesting for some.</li>
    <li><b>Save Map:</b> Saves the current star system configuration with the current zoom level to a PNG file.
        This opens a new dialog where you can tweak some settings, but the aforementioned settings are applied to the
        export, i.e. a zoomed in map will created a larger file than a zoomed out one.<br/>
        <img src="res\readme\mapExport.png"><br>
        Most settings should be self explanatory. If "<i>Draw Faction Colors</i>" is unticked, the system names will be
        black or white, depending on the "<i>Draw White Background</i>" setting (which I included for easier printing).<br>
        The default output directory is the current directory where <i>BATTLETECH Star Systems</i> is located and will
        automatically rename the default name if a file already exists (e.g. "map1.png", "map2.png", etc.).
        However, you may manually select a file name and choose to override any existing files.
    </li>
    <li><b>Opten BT folder:</b> With this buttong you can change your BATTLETECH folder in case you need it (i.e. should
        you have more than one installation).
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The Right Panel</h3>
<p>
    On the right you have a list of all star systems that fulfill the current set of attributes.
    Hovering the mouse over a planet name will expand the panel to show a more detailed view of the system.
    Furthermore, the star system is highlighted on the map.
</p>

<h2>The INI File</h2>
<p>
    After running the program for the first time, an INI file is created automatically for some additional options.
    While most of the info saved there for convenience reasons (GUI and last saved folder), there are two settings that
    might be of interest:
    <ul>
    <li><b>calculateStats:</b> Running <i>BATTLETECH Star Systems</i> with this set to "<i>true</i>" will create a
        CSV file that contains the owner, employer and target faction statistics of <b>all</b> loaded planets.
        While this information is also available in the GUI, I found it more convenient to have the data separately in
        order to adequately analyze the data and plan my next career route.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>directDirectorySelection:</b> By setting <i>this</i> to true you choose the folder that contains the star system
        JSON files directly instead of just selecting the main BATTLETECH folder.
        <b>WARNING!!!</b> Make sure that you select the right folder (by either entering the right
        path in the INI file or deleting the old path from <i>lastDir</i> and then selecting the path through the dialog),
        otherwise the program will not work correctly.
    </li>
    <li><b>useLog:</b> This is basically a debug option. Setting this to "<i>true</i>" will then create a "log.html"
        when running the program which displays some info about the program.</li>
</ul>
